# SoftballProAI — Become a Founding Member

**Your kid's private, always-on softball coach — powered by AI and real biomechanics.**

## The Story

Hi — I'm Kimberly, a single mom from Atlanta and Shannon's biggest fan.

For years, chronic illness (Lyme disease and fibromyalgia) made it hard to function. But after starting HRT therapy, my focus came roaring back. For the last few weeks I've been working 10+ hours a day learning AI and building something that can change the game for young softball players.

**SoftballProAI** analyzes swing and pitch videos instantly, breaking down biomechanics (arm slot, knee flexion, torque separation) and providing personalized training plans. It's like having a private coach in your pocket — one that never sleeps and is obsessed with helping your player reach her potential.

## Current Status (Feb 2026)

✅ **Player mode is working** — Real-time video analysis with biomechanics breakdown  
✅ **AI brain trained** — Rules, drills, coaching techniques, injury prevention loaded  
🚀 **Next:** Coach dashboard, team features, polished UI

## Why I'm Fundraising

We're 30 days from serious financial pressure. I need help to cover:
- One month of rent & essentials
- Paid AI tool credits (Lovable, Replit, API access)
- Enough runway to finish the MVP

## The Promise

This is **not charity** — it's a bridge.

**Double Payback Promise:** I will personally return **2× whatever you contribute** once the product launches and generates revenue.

Plus:
- Lifetime free account
- Founding Member badge
- Your name in credits (optional)

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Supabase (database)
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel (hosting)

## Get Started

```bash
