# AI Softball Pro - Project Rules

## Project Context
This is a multi-stack athlete management software specifically for softball players.
Stack: [FILL IN: React/Vue? Node/Python backend? Database?]
Target Users: Softball coaches and players

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Before Implementing Features - ASK:
1. "Is this feature for coaches, players, or both?"
2. "Does this need real-time updates or can it be async?"
3. "Should this data be stored locally or in the database?"
4. "What happens if a player/coach is offline?"

### Domain-Specific Terms
- Use softball terminology correctly (at-bats, ERA, fielding percentage, etc.)
- "Athlete" in our context = softball player
- Coach vs Player permissions matter - always clarify which role

### Data Privacy & Security
- Player data is sensitive - always implement proper auth checks
- Never expose personal player info in URLs or logs
- Coaches should only see their team's data

### UI/UX Priorities
- Mobile-first design (coaches use phones at practice)
- Quick data entry (minimize typing during games)
- Offline capability for field use (no WiFi at ballparks)
- Visual stats dashboards over text-heavy reports

### Performance Requirements
- Keep app responsive even with 20+ players on roster
- Optimize video playback (technique analysis)
- Cache frequently accessed player stats

### Stop and Ask If:
- You're about to create a new component that might already exist
- The data model seems unclear or inconsistent
- You're unsure whether data should be client-side or server-side
- Authentication/permissions logic is involved

### Testing Scenarios to Consider
- Empty roster (new coach signup)
- Single player vs full team
- Poor network connection
- Different user roles (head coach, assistant, player, parent)

## File Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (PlayerCard.jsx)
- Utilities: camelCase (calculateBattingAverage.js)
- Hooks: use prefix (usePlayerStats.js)
- Types: PascalCase with .types.ts suffix (Player.types.ts)

## Error Messages
- User-friendly language (not technical jargon)
- Specific actions they can take ("Try refreshing" vs "Error 500")
- Log technical details to console for debugging
